### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given a set of attributes for an Individual,

1. Determine if a credit line should be extended to the individual.

2. If so, what should the repayment terms be in business recommendations?

3. The main challenge is to minimise the risk of NPAs by flagging defaulters while maximising opportunity to earn interest by disbursing loans to as many customers as possible.
